## About The Project

![GIF_FILE_DEMO_APP](https://github.com/Sudeep-K/Research-Buddy/blob/main/researchbuddy.gif)

This project was part of the two day hackathon organized by UXCam Nepal.

The goal of this Project was due to following reasons:

- Formatting and collecting sources for research papers or essays can be a time-consuming and error-prone task
- Extension can reduce the risk of citation errors by automating the citation process
- How do we collaborate as a group of four members on the same software? How do we select which features to implement, and which to skip, with regrads to the time constraint set on the project?
